# Pothole_Classification_Mini_Project

- Pothole is defined as cavity in a road surface. Potholes affect road  quality,  driver  safety,  vehicle  structure,  and  fuel  consumption.
- In developing countries where resources are limited, using artificial intelligence methods to detect and classify potholes can help to improve road conditions. 
- The proposed method based on convolutional neural networks does have the potential to compete with the existing techniques of pothole classification.
