# Requirements
## Introduction
- With the increase in population, the number of vehicles and traffic on roads are increasing too.
- With increasing vehicular traffic and pollution on roads, managing such an amount of traffic has become very tough.
- Potholes and road surface anomalies are the primary cause of road accidents.
- Road conditions such as potholes, cracks, etc., should be identified to prevent road accidents and significant injuries.
- A pothole can put the life of a driver and fellow passengers in danger.

## Research

- Truman Shen, Gregory Schamp, Mario Haddad explored Stereo vision-based road surface preview in 2014. This paper proposes the use of Takataâ€™s stereo-vision system for performing a road surface preview along with the host vehicle.

- Manjusha Ghadge, Dheeraj Pandey, Dhananjay Kalbande used an accelerometer and GPS to analyze road conditions.[click to view paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7456932)
- A.TedeschiF, Benedetto used various technologies of the OpenCV library to classify three different types of road distresses. This system identifies road distress, fatigue cracks, longitudinal and traversal cracks, and potholes in real-time.[click to view paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474034616301197?casa_token=zkur3F9ZoqcAAAAA:EERBlOi_zX74pszRRhFx3dzMuez8WkA1NH_NRE_r8uEQptTM9nnUGzrpFKFF2KYxNvjXW3RtLSE)


## Cost and Features

### Cost
- The cost for pothole classification is nill since it uses open source software.
- For pothole detection various tools will be used such as sensors and for deployment of software cost will be accordingly.
### Features

## Defining the System
The project aims to build a model that can classify pothole images. To increase the accuracy of model various data augmentation technique has been used on the dataset.

## 4W's and 1'H
### Who:
This will be helpful for drivers in avoiding potholes and a possible accident.  
### What:
A model to classify potholes and normal images to avoid potholes on the road.
### When:
When drivers face difficulty to identify the potholes due to the poor road conditions, which leads to severe accidents.
### Where:
While driving it is crucial to have information about the road surface through which the vehicle travels.
### How:
A machine learning-based pothole classification model to detect potholes in images. Images of roads with pothole and non-pothole are collected and preprocessed. Using CNN architecture the images are classified into normal and pothole images.
